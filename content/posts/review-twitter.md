# Configuration

Site configuration is found in `/config/_siteConfig.js`. Here you can customize site settings such as the site name, layout, disqus and mailchimp setup, image sizes and more. Any of these can be setup to use environment variables if you so desire, in order to be able to configure them directly from the Netlify interface. See the setup for google analytics which already uses an environment variable as an example of this.

# Editing Content

Posts and categories can be edited in Netlify CMS at \[your-site-url]/admin. At this time any new pages must be created in the code itself and committed to the repo. Before you visit the admin for the first time, make sure you have [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) setup with your user and make sure "Git Gateway" is enabled via the Identity Settings page in the Netlify admin. 

# Local Development

Since all content is store in the git repo with Netlify CMS, local development is a breeze. Simply install node, pull down the repo, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and run `npm run dev`.
